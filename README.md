## Description

This project is an advanced macro that uses image recongnition to intelligently automate repetitive tasks in the mobile game "Final Fantasy Brave Exvius: War of the Visions"

It runs alongside BlueStacks and reads the game screen to make decisions.  This allows it to avoid wasting time clicking empty areas of the screen like a typical macro would.  It also allows it to detect frozen screens or when the game crashes, which is a common issue with BlueStacks.
